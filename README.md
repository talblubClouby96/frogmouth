You can also install it via `pip`:

Whichever method you use, you should have a `frogmouth` command on your path.

## Running

Enter `frogmouth` at the prompt to run the app, optionally followed by a path to a Markdown file:

```

```

You can navigate with the mouse or the keyboard.
Use **tab** and **shift+tab** to navigate between the various controls on screen.
